            <p class="card-info">description: The Magician symbolizes deity, skill, self-consciousness, and an active lifestyle. It indicates a period in which we can overcome difficult problems, with increased awareness and a vigilant wisdom to face challenges. Although this card represents the power of our consciousness, it does not express that emotions and other subconscious forces are negligible. On the contrary, the extraordinary power and efficiency exemplified by the Magus is based on the deep harmony between consciousness and subconsciousness. Only the resulting internal security can move mountains. The first human act of life is born from nothing, without experience and learning: this is the first instinctive creation. Spontaneous creation without goals and interests, in which one tries his strength and experiences his abilities.</p>
